16,5,Very Nice 👍
17,4,"Samsung makes good tv's. With monitors, it's a little different. From 2 feet distance, even the lowest brightness settings on this are severely discomforting. Only way to use this is to turn down rbg individually at zero brightness. Then, this becomes useful.The eye care mode is a joke - the panel would become warm and really bright while the brightness settings are disabled.If you want to buy Samsung - like I did - get this. Good for watching content now n then. For serious 10 hr+ workdays..."

28,5,"It's a very good product has good clarity, adequate refresh rate  and is pretty reasonable priced. I want to specifically mention that though this does not have height adjustment,but INCLUDES TILT ADJUSTMENT. Please check for screws in the cavity of the notch in the stand you are attaching to the back of the monitor.,( They are under a black tape sometimes) else everything is worth the money"

45,4,"Display quality Very good.  And comes with IPS display which is usually used in our phone, only then its quality is very good, I am telling you to use it after 2 days and you get 3 year guarantee from Samsung company.  What to fear for 3 years when Samsung is with us that too at this price yes if it had speakers and inbuilt speaker then it would have been fun and the design build quality is very good The only drawback is there is no inbuilt speaker..☺️🙂"

Bezzles are thin, look wise goodCons:This is not a con but it took me a while to get that the power itself is the menu control button.There are only 1 HDMI (cable included in the box, I really appreciate that) and 1 old school VGA which is of no use these days for many of the people.I'm not a fan of the power brick...."

64,5,Nice samsung monitor always best
65,5,"I have been using this monitor for 6 months as of now. The monitor is good, has good color output, enough space for multitasking. But, as it is a 24 inch monitor, we can clearly see the lack of details while watching a Full HD movie or any such kind of high resolution content. Initially I had set up this monitor and tried to tilt adjust the screen for a better viewing angle. But, I was unable to do so. The screen was always facing down in an awkward angle. I thought, how dumb could SAMSUNG b..."
66,5,Nyc product qulity
67,4,As per Specifications all are top of the mark but one thing I would like unhide about this monitor is that when you enable eye saver mode the brightness controller get disable which I personally don't like as I think brightness level is bit high for me to work for long hours. And also there's only one HDMI and one VGA port available here there should be one more DP or HDMI port available on this for smooth work flow with other devices. Otherwise for flipkart side 5 stars for thier delivery be...

Afterall this is a samsung product so quite naturally I did expect the picture quality to be great and I must say rather than being not just disappointed I am totally satiated .

232,3,Fine now but I will review after using it for 6 months
233,3,This product doesn't have audio port otherwise product is very good
234,3,Disappointed ! Eye care mode is pathetic. Didn't expect this from Samsung. For multimedia consumption or gaming it may be good but not for long time reading.
235,3,Text pixels are not good it's totally blurred unsatisfied with the product 😏👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 better to go for Dell or hp
236,3,Height of monitor stand is small and not adjustable
237,3,Everything is good expect the brightness is so high
238,2,Picture quality is very bad for an IPS panel. My eye strain after 30 min of use. I would suggest the dell 22 inch monitor which I feel is more color accurate. Not worth the price even when its discounted

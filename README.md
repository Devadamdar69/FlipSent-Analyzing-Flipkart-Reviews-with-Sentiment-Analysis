## Overview

The FlipSent project utilizes web scraping with BeautifulSoup to gather product reviews. It focuses on extracting sentiment using ratings (positive for 5 stars, negative otherwise). The NLP pipeline includes text preprocessing, word cloud generation for visualization, and training a machine learning model for sentiment classification. Finally, a confusion matrix evaluates the model's performance.
